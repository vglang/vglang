/// The ‘rect’ element defines a rectangle which is axis-aligned with the current user coordinate system.
/// Rounded rectangles can be achieved by setting appropriate values for attributes ‘rx’ and ‘ry’.
///
///
/// The values used for the x- and y-axis rounded corner radii are determined implicitly if the ‘rx’ or ‘ry’ attributes (or both) are not specified, or are specified but with invalid values. The values are also subject to clamping so that the lengths of the straight segments of the rectangle are never negative. The effective values for ‘rx’ and ‘ry’ are determined by following these steps in order:
///
/// 1. Let rx and ry be length values.
/// 1. If neither ‘rx’ nor ‘ry’ are properly specified, then set both rx and ry to 0. (This will result in square corners.)
/// 1. Otherwise, if a properly specified value is provided for ‘rx’, but not for ‘ry’, then set both rx and ry to the value of ‘rx’.
/// 1. Otherwise, if a properly specified value is provided for ‘ry’, but not for ‘rx’, then set both rx and ry to the value of ‘ry’.
/// 1. Otherwise, both ‘rx’ and ‘ry’ were specified properly. Set rx to the value of ‘rx’ and ry to the value of ‘ry’.
/// 1. If rx is greater than half of ‘width’, then set rx to half of ‘width’.
/// 1. If ry is greater than half of ‘height’, then set ry to half of ‘height’.
/// 1. The effective values of ‘rx’ and ‘ry’ are rx and ry, respectively.
